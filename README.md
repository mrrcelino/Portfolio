# Portfolio

### About me :wave:
Hello! My name is Marcelino, and since early 2024, I've embarked on a journey to master Quality Assurance (QA). It's been a fulfilling path, discovering a field where I can thrive and contribute significantly. Looking ahead, I aspire to be a professional dedicated to enhancing the quality of products and services. Through this portfolio, I aim to convey the depth of my QA expertise and the hands-on experience I've cultivated via coursework and independent learning. My ambition is to continually evolve in this domain. Currently, I'm delving into test automation with Python, focusing on expanding both my theoretical understanding and practical application in this exciting area.
